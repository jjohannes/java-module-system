# Java Module System (with Gradle)

This is a minimalistic project that shows a structured Java project setup utilising the
[Java Module System (JPMS)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.7)
to define a modular software structure with
[Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle)
as the underlying build system.
To integrate these, the 
[GradleX](https://gradlex.org/)
Java development plugins are used.

With this setup, modularization and other build configuration concerns are separated.
With that accidental complexity in the module setup is avoided.

### Build the example

- Run `./gradlew check` to run tests and check integrity of the module setup
- To build a self-contained installable of the application, run:
  - Run `./gradlew assembleWindows-2022`
  - Run `./gradlew assembleMacos-13`
  - Run `./gradlew assembleMacos-14`
  - Run `./gradlew assembleUbuntu-22.04`

The example also builds on GitHub.
